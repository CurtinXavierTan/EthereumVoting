## Description

This is repository for Sprint 3

Task 4.2.3 Experiment with blockchain platform to ensure a voting system can be implemented

I have experimented a prototype application using Ethereum by following the tutorial:

## Code or Application is available upon reqeust

Because the prototype's size is very huge and it takes a very long to be uploaded, I have decided to provide a screenshot for the size:

## Getting Started

The following screenshots will explain what the prototype does.

The prototype creates 10 random accounts to test with automatically.

I have created an Web instance (bottom terminal) to connect to the blockchain server (upper terminal) as shown.

After everything is set up, I can either use console to vote or use html page to vote.

From the screenshot, you can see that whenever I vote a person, the transaction id is shown on the left size of the screenshot.

Block number and block time are also given as well.

You can zoom it for better result.
